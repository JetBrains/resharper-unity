    <!-- Use a per project obj folder in a common build folder. Each project needs its own obj folder, as this contains
         e.g. nuget import files and generated files, and can't be shared across all projects.
         Note that we must set it in Directory.Build.Props as Microsoft.Common.props (included by Microsoft.Net.Sdk)
         will set the property and immediately use it. Fortunately, it includes Directory.build.props first.
         Also make sure that obj folder is outside of the project folder, or the default wildcards will include it in
         the project

    <!-- The main plugin projects (Unity, Unity.Rider, Unity.VisualStudio, Unity.Shaders, Yaml, Json, etc.) are all
         built into a single bin folder, to reduce copies of the SDK. Technically, we can run tests from this folder
         without problems, because the test environment is created from assemblies referenced by the test assembly, and
         we handle zoning correctly. However, TC wants to run the tests in parallel, so let's build tests to separate
         folders.
         Non-plugin projects will get the default $(OutputPath) set above, as will test projects. Plugins will use the
         output path below and build to a central location.
         For reference, the standard SDK package entry points would mean that production code would skip copying
         @(JetContent) such as external annotations or schemas, would also skip copying all product assemblies defined
         in @(JetReference) and would set JetReferencesPrivate=False to avoid creating a private copy of reference
         assemblies in the bin dir. For test projects, JetTestProject=True, and @(JetContent) and @(JetReference) are
         always copied. -->

  <!-- Do not try to auto-unify referenced assembly versions. The SDK has a couple of clashes that are not easily
       solved. E.g. the SDK has an exact reference on System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.nupkg 4.5.3, which brings
       in System.Runtime.CompilerServices.dll 4.0.4.1. The Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.dll references 5.0.0, which can't be
       resolved as we're stuck on the 4.5.3 package.
       This will normally give a warning about an unresolved version conflict, as msbuild will try to generate binding
       redirects, but it doesn't appear to do anything else - the binding redirects might be calculated, but they're not
       output for a class library unless we set GenerateBindingRedirectsOutputType to true. In which case, we get a
       .dll.config file that contains the references that were auto-unified. If the reference has a conflict, it's not
       resolved, so doesn't get output.
       We don't actually care because we have no requirements for a specific version of a reference, and especially not
       for a reference that could introduce a conflict. We're just a plugin and want to compile against and load the
       versions of the assemblies used by the product. So we disable calculating binding redirects, and as a side
       effect, remove the big warnings. -->
