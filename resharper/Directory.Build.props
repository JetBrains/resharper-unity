  <!-- We have multiple projects in the same folder, so need to rename the bin and obj
       folders so that they are unique and we don't overwrite anything. We can do this
       in the project files for the bin folders, but not for the obj folders, because
       the Sdk attribute indirectly imports Microsoft.Common.props before we have a
       chance to set any properties. Microsoft.Common.props defines the BaseIntermediateOutputPath
       value, and then immediately uses it to include props files from the obj folder,
       before we've had a chance to override it. Fortunately, this Directory.Build.props
       file gets automatically imported first, so we can override it here.
       We also have to set it to something outside of the source tree, or the default
       wildcard includes only exclude bin and obj for the current project, and we'd
       pick up extra files.
