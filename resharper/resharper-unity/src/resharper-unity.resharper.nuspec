    <summary>ReSharper support for the Unity engine</summary>
    <description>Adds support for the Unity engine.

- Code completion of event function declarations in a class.
- Use Generate Code to create event functions, with parameters, or start typing for automatic completion.
- Highlights Unity event functions and serializable fields and marks as implicitly used by Unity.
- Supports Unity API 5.0 - 2019.3, plus undocumented functions.
- Inspections, Quick Fixes and Context Actions for Unity specific issues, with documented explanations.
- Performance indicators to avoid known code patterns that affect performance.
- Parse class and method usage from scene, prefab and assets.
- Support for ShaderLab and Assembly Definition files.
- Automatically connect debugger to Unity editor.
- Lists and debugs external players.
- Extra Unity data in debugger views.
- Play/pause/step directly from Rider.
- View Unity console in Rider, with parsed stack traces and text filter.
- Run Unity editor tests directly from Rider.
- Unity Explorer to view project as shown in Unity's Assets view, with Packages.
- Navigate to external Unity documentation.
- Correctly updates .meta files.
- Code completion, rename and find usages for "magic strings" in method calls.
- Automatically adds FormerlySerializedAs attribute when renaming fields.
- Automatically sets Unity projects to C# 4 or C# 6. No more suggestions for features that won't compile!
- Highlights UnityEngine.Color and Color32. Edit via colour palette quick fix.
- Unity specific file and live templates.
- And much more!

<releaseNotes>
New in 2020.1

Added:
- Add performance inspection - prefer jagged array to multidimensional array access, with Quick Fix (RIDER-22812, #1459)
- Exclude Boo and UnityScript namespaces, as well as the System.Diagnostics.Debug type from import completion (#574, #1473)
- Add more attributes to external annotations. E.g. ShortcutAttribute will mark the method as in use (#1546, RIDER-40330, #1548)
- Find Usages for serialised fields now includes asset usages (#1530)

Changed:
- Indexing of assets deferred until after project loaded and will not interfere with existing code insight features (#1530)
- Improved memory usage while parsing assets (#1530)
- Improved support of nested and variant prefabs (#1530)
- Serialised field values Code Vision now includes values from FomerlySerialisedAs attribute (#1530)
- Serialised field values Code Vision now includes derived classes (#1550)
- Show performance critical highlights for known methods without requiring Solution Wide Analysis enabled (#1459)
- Stop marking a method as expensive if it only contains a null check (#1459)
- Move vector multiplication order inspection to performance critical context only (#1459)
- Updated API information to 2020.1.0a25 (#1553)
- Remove messages that use obsolete parameter types (#1545, #1553)

Fixed:
- Fix incorrect redundant SerializeField attribute warning for property backing field (#1016, #1464)
- Avoid creating meta files outside of Asset or Packages folders (from 2019.3.2) (#1481, #1491, #1489)
- Fix overwriting IEnumerator when auto-completing an event function that can be a coroutine (#1258, #1566)
- Fix duplicate "Generate Unity event functions" context action when gutter icons are visible (#1537, #1566)
