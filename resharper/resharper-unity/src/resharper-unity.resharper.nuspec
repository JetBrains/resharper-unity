    <summary>ReSharper support for the Unity engine</summary>
    <description>Adds support for the Unity engine.

- Code completion of event function declarations in a class.
- Use Generate Code to create event functions, with parameters, or start typing for automatic completion.
- Highlights Unity event functions and serializable fields and marks as implicitly used by Unity.
- Supports Unity API 5.0 - 2018.3, plus undocumented functions.
- Inspections, Quick Fixes and Context Actions for Unity specific issues, with documented explanations.
- Performance indicators to avoid known code patterns that affect performance.
- Parse class and method usage from scene, prefab and assets.
- Support for ShaderLab and Assembly Definition files.
- Automatically connect debugger to Unity editor.
- Lists and debugs external players.
- Extra Unity data in debugger views.
- Play/pause/step directly from Rider.
- View Unity console in Rider, with parsed stack traces and text filter.
- Run Unity editor tests directly from Rider.
- Unity Explorer to view project as shown in Unity's Assets view, with Packages.
- Navigate to external Unity documentation.
- Correctly updates .meta files.
- Code completion, rename and find usages for "magic strings" in method calls.
- Automatically adds FormerlySerializedAs attribute when renaming fields.
- Automatically sets Unity projects to C# 4 or C# 6. No more suggestions for features that won't compile!
- Highlights UnityEngine.Color and Color32. Edit via colour palette quick fix.
- Unity specific file and live templates.

- Add support for marking ECS types and fields as "in use" (#1010, #1036)
- Add gutter icon indicator for event function that "hides" a private event function in a base class (RIDER-14698, #1081)
- Add Unity version to error report environment details (#1103)
- Add ability to find similar issues for performance indicators (#1109)

Changed:

- Performance critical context now works cross files (#1037)
- Event functions can be grouped by base classes in Generate dialog (#810, #1081)
- No longer creates a .sln.DotSettings.user file when YAML size heuristic is applied (#1087)
- Treat AddComponent(Type) as an expensive operation (#1044, #1109)

- Correctly update name of existing method declaration with code completion (RIDER-9555, RIDER-14037, #0181)
- Only show event function completion in classes, not structs or interfaces (RIDER-14147, #420, #1081)
- Respect existing access modifier in code completion (RIDER-15290, #1081)
- Remove incorrect method signature warning if method is implementing a virtual method (#876, #1081)
- Fix spelling mistake in issue suppression comment (#1083, #1109)
