------------------------------------------------
0: Accessor must declare a body because 'property' is not marked as abstract or extern. Auto-properties must define both 'get' and 'set' accessors.
QUICKFIXES:
Make property 'Prop' abstract
To property with serialized backing field
Add accessor body
To property with backing field
Set C# language level to '6.0' for code analysis of this project (doesn't affect build)
