[assembly: RequiresSTA]

// This attribute is marked obsolete but is still supported. Use is discouraged in preference to convention, but the
// convention doesn't work for us. That convention is to walk up the tree from the executing assembly and look for a
// relative path called "test/data". This doesn't work because our common "build" folder is one level above our
// "test/data" folder, so it doesn't get found. We want to keep the common "build" folder, but allow multiple "modules"
// with separate "test/data" folders. E.g. "resharper-unity" and "resharper-yaml"

// TODO: This makes things work when building as part of the Unity project, but breaks standalone
// Maybe it should be using product/subplatform markers?
