# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0). Note that this project does not follow semantic versioning but uses version numbers based on JetBrains [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) releases.

This plugin has functionality that is common to both ReSharper and Rider. It also contains a plugin for the Unity editor that is used to communicate with Rider. Changes marked with a "Rider:" prefix are specific to Rider, while changes for the Unity editor plugin are marked with a "Unity editor:" prefix. No prefix means that the change is common to both Rider and ReSharper.

Since 2018.1, the version numbers and release cycle match Rider's versions and release dates. The plugin is always bundled with Rider, but is released for ReSharper separately. Sometimes the ReSharper version isn't released. This is usually because the changes are not applicable to ReSharper, but also by mistake.
