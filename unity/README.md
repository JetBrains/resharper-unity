# Unity Editor plugin

Rider support for Unity:
* Debugging of Unity instances.
    * Use the Run &rarr; "Attach to local process" menu item to list available Unity instances.
    * Run &rarr; "Edit Configurations" &rarr; Add new "Mono remote" configuration to set everything manually.

Additional Rider support for Unity via [ReSharper plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity#readme) (File&rarr;Settings&rarr;Plugins&rarr;Type Unity&rarr;Press "search in repositories"&rarr;ReSharper Unity plugin will be found&rarr;Install.&rarr;Restart Rider.). 

However, Unity does not currently support Rider. This plugin adds that support:

* An "Open C# Project in Rider" item to the Assets menu.
    * Open file is fast and Rider is focused after opening file.
* Double click a C# script file or error message in Unity will open Rider and navigate to the corresponding file and line.
* Runs on Windows, Linux and macOS.
* Sets language level when generating project files
    * Sets language level to C# 4, so that Rider does not suggest C# 6 language features.
    * Sets language level to C# 6 when targeting .NET 4.6 in Unity 5.5.
    * Sets language level to C# 6 or C# 7.0 when using the [CSharp60Support](https://bitbucket.org/alexzzzz/unity-c-5.0-and-6.0-integration/src) plugin.
* Fixes an issue with Rider on Mono 4 where System.Linq references cannot be found (see [RIDER-573](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-573)).
* Ensures `UnityEditor.iOS.XCode` namespaces are referenced correctly (see https://github.com/JetBrains/Unity3dRider/issues/15). 
* Support for gmcs.rsp and smcs.rsp keywords define and unsafe (see https://github.com/JetBrains/Unity3dRider/pull/46).

## How to use

**Set Rider as the default External Script Editor**

Plugin will try to find Rider executable automatically and add it to known editors list, 
but if it fails, you may need to point it once:

1. Open Unity.
2. Go to Edit &rarr; Preferences &rarr; External Tools.
3. Select "Browse" in the External Script Editor dropdown and select the Rider application.
    1. On Windows, navigate to `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\JetBrains Toolbox` or `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\JetBrains` and select "Rider"
    2. On Mac, select `~/Applications/Jet Brains/Toolbox/Rider.app` or `/Applications/Rider.app`
    3. On Linux, select `rider.sh`

**Install the plugin into your project**

You don't need to manually copy the plugin to your solution. After opening your solution in Rider the ReSharper Unity plugin will automatically copy JetBrains.Rider.Unity.Editor.Plugin.Repacked.dll into `Assets/Plugins/Editor/JetBrains`. Next time you focus Unity window the solution will recompile and initialize it. You can move the dll into different directory, given that it's still inside `Assets` â€” it will be detected and updated accordingly by the ReSharper Unity plugin.

## Roadmap 

This plugin is intended to be lightweight and simple, and is not intended to do much more than it currently does. If you have any issues or feature suggestions with regard to plugin functionality inside Unity, please [file an issue with unity-plugin label](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity/issues).

If you have any issues or feature suggestion for Unity functionality inside Rider, please [file an issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/resharper-unity/issues).

Any issues or feature suggestion for Rider itself, please [file an issue with Rider](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/RIDER)
