&#8226; Use Generate Code to create event functions, with parameters.
&#8226; Start typing for automatic completion of event function declarations in a class.
&#8226; Event function descriptions for methods and parameters displayed in tooltips and QuickDoc
&#8226; "Read more" in QuickDoc navigates to Unity API documentation.
&#8226; Correctly update .meta files.
